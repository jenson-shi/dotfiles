# README

This is a very basic emacs starter kit. It is more or less 100% empty and ready to do what ever you want to make it into. But I have configured the built in package manager and installed use-package. I recommend learning how to use it to installing emacs packages from the start. If you need some inspiration you might want to take a look at my personal config [here](https://github.com/hjertnes/emacs.d) if you want some inspiration or tips. There is also a some tips and more coming in my [wiki](https://wiki.hjertnes.blog). Just clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d
